Welcome to 3mugs.com!

1. Your relationship with 3mugs.com

    1.1 Your use of 3mugs.com’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by 3mugs.com under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and 3mugs.com. “3mugs.com” means 3mugs.com Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

    1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with 3mugs.com, your agreement with 3mugs.com will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.

    1.3 Your agreement with 3mugs.com will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

    1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and 3mugs.com in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

    1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

2. Accepting the Terms

    2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.

    2.2 You can accept the Terms by:

        (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by 3mugs.com in the user interface for any Service; or

        (B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that 3mugs.com will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

    2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with 3mugs.com, or (b) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.

    2.4 Before you continue, you should print off or save a local copy of the Universal Terms for your records.

3. Language of the Terms

    3.1 Where 3mugs.com has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with 3mugs.com.

    3.2 If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.

4. Provision of the Services by 3mugs.com

    4.1 3mugs.com has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world (“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”).

    4.2 3mugs.com is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which 3mugs.com provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.
